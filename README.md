# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## 📖 Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** commonly used for **classification** and **regression** tasks. KNN is a simple, yet powerful, non-parametric algorithm that makes predictions by finding the closest data points (neighbors) in the training dataset.

## 🚀 How KNN Works

1. **Choose the Number of Neighbors (K)**  
   Decide how many neighbors (`K`) to use for predictions. Common choices are small integers like `3`, `5`, or `7`.

2. **Calculate the Distance**  
   Use a distance metric (e.g., **Euclidean Distance**, **Manhattan Distance**, or **Minkowski Distance**) to measure the similarity between points.

   **Euclidean Distance Formula**:  
   \[
   d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}
   \]

3. **Identify the Nearest Neighbors**  
   Sort the distances and select the `K` closest data points.

4. **Predict the Output**:  
   - For **classification**, use a majority vote of the `K` nearest neighbors.  
   - For **regression**, take the average of the `K` nearest neighbors' values.
